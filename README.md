### Background Story:
I picked up a Nikon F, FTN finder, and a Nikkor 55mm f1.2 to make a NASA Nikon F. While that particular project is on the backburner, I wanted to shoot the Nikon F with something that wasn't so obtrusively large. I had a broken Canon FTb and figured I could probably use the prism for a DIY viewfinder on my Nikon F. Along with the eye level finder I wanted the cool hipster waist level finder so I could be cool too. For the WLF I picked up the official WLF so I had a point of reference to build on.

There will be more accessories coming down the pipeline like an L-Bracket or Arca-Swiss compatible Grip.
