### What you'll need:
- 4x M1.6 x 5mm pan head screws (PETG) or self-tappin screws (ABS or PETG)
- 1x M1.6 tap
- 1x 55mm length of 1.75mm filament for upper baffle hinge
- 1x 50mm length of 1.75mm filament for lower baffle hinge
- Sheet of Leatherette

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit
- M1.8/M2 drill bit
- Micro files

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientationFile.3mf' files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M1.6 requires M1.4 bore followed by an M1.6 tap.
- M1.8 or M2 bore for screw holes that aren't tapped.
- Bore the hinge holes with an M2 drill bit. Go slowly to keep heat generation down to a minmum. Use water to cool the bit while boring. 
- The hinges are simply lengths of filament with the ends hot riveted down. I use a lighter to set the filament on fire and a bronze punch to hot rivet the end. Do on both sides to lock the hinge in place.
- For the lower baffle you will need to file the hot riveted head down so the upper baffle will close properly. 

Test fit before assembling. Will need to file parts to allow free movement. Depending on your printer you'll have to file down the baffles for them to open and close freely

For the leatherette print the <a href="https://github.com/Archive-663/nikonF/blob/main/ASSETS/TEMPLATES" target='_blank'>leatherette cutting template file</a>. Apply contact cement to both surfaces and adhere the leatherette.

To assemble correctly, please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, <a href="https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">download FreeCAD</a> to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble. If using FreeCAD, the naming conventions should carry over and you will be able to see which lens element you need from the various smartphone lenses. (Verified in FreeCAD 0.18) If using something like Solid Edge open the file as an assembly to retain the names of the parts.
